   <h4>Entry 2: Drama Class</h4>
   <p class="one">So this week and last week have been rough with Drama Class because I feel
   that people hate me in my play I am doing like Emma, Rose, Katlyn, Devon, Cositte (Don't
   know how to spell her name) and sightly Aaliyah
   because of how I act and yes some of it I understand but I just think that I
   don't feel welcome to be apart of the play which I am sad of but I still got
   to do the play. Yes I have chosen Drama for next year but I am starting to regret it all ready.
   I don't know if people have picked up on it. I do not know what Adrian would do if I told him this
   and I want to talk to Finn about it but how everything is going at the moment
   I don't know if it would be good. So I guess that I have to try not get over my head
   which is sad but the show must go on. <br /><br />That is this week of Personal Diary<br />Thanks for Reading<br />Ryan Sturgess</p>
